The Java wrapper generator has been completely rewritten and uses now OpenAPI definition of the Spotify Web API as source.

Therefore, some model class names have changed and many fixes are included.

- The library now also requires Java 17

  - The `ids` parameter in the `RemoveShowsUserRequest` and `SaveShowsUserRequest` is now passed in the body
  - Add `htmlDescription` and `restrictions` fields to `Episode` and `SimplifiedEpisode`
  - Fix `SearchResponse` object

## [2.0.0]
Complete rewrite of the library. The models and endpoints are generated from output of my [spotify-web-api-parser](https://github.com/sonallux/spotify-web-api) which generates a machine-readable format of the [Spotify Web API Reference](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference). This results in a lot of breaking changes around naming of objects, properties, endpoints and parameters. 

Other notable changes:

- Renamed the maven groupId from `de.jsone-studios` to `de.sonallux.spotify`
- Renamed package from `de.jsone_studios.wrapper.spotify` to `de.sonallux.spotify.api`
- Removed `SpotifyApi` interface in favour of an updated `SpotifyWebApi` class
- `SpotifyWebApi` uses the builder pattern to create an instance
- Replaced [retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit) with a custom wrapper around [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp)
- Requests are now created with a builder style api for optional parameters. For example:
```java
ApiCall<?> call1 = spotifyWebApi.getXApi().getX("requiredParam").build();
ApiCall<?> call2 = spotifyWebApi.getXApi().getX("requiredParam").optionalParam1("Y").build();
```
- Removed `SpotifyApi.callApi()` in favour of an `executeCall()` method on the new `ApiCall` class
- Removed `SpotifyApi.callApiAndReturnBody()` in favour of an `execute()` method on the new `ApiCall` class
- Added support for all authorization flows. See [here](https://github.com/sonallux/spotify-web-api-java/tree/main#authorization) for more details.
- Bump minimum required Java version to Java 11
