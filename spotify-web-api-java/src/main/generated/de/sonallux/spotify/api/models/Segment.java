     * <p>Timbre is the quality of a musical note or sound that distinguishes different types of musical instruments, or voices. It is a complex notion also referred to as sound color, texture, or tone quality, and is derived from the shape of a segment’s spectro-temporal surface, independently of pitch and loudness. The timbre feature is a vector that includes 12 unbounded values roughly centered around 0. Those values are high level abstractions of the spectral surface, ordered by degree of importance.</p>
     * <p>For completeness however, the first dimension represents the average loudness of the segment; second emphasizes brightness; third is more closely correlated to the flatness of a sound; fourth to sounds with a stronger attack; etc. See an image below representing the 12 basis functions (i.e. template segments).
     * <img src="https://developer.spotify.com/assets/audio/Timbre_basis_functions.png" alt="timbre basis functions" /></p>
     * <p>The actual timbre of the segment is best described as a linear combination of these 12 basis functions weighted by the coefficient values: timbre = c1 x b1 + c2 x b2 + ... + c12 x b12, where c1 to c12 represent the 12 coefficients and b1 to b12 the 12 basis functions as displayed below. Timbre vectors are best used in comparison with each other.</p>
